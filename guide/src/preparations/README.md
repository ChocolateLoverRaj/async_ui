# Preparations

This chapter goes over what you need before you can start
writing UI code with Async UI!

### Note on Environment
The tool installation and project set-up steps are written for Linux and
have only been tested on Linux.

They *should* work on MacOS and Windows too. But if you're on those platforms,
please don't just copy paste commands!
pay attention to shell output to make sure no unexpected errors come up.

If an error (or any other breakage) comes up,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/wishawa/async_ui/issues)!
