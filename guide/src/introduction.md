# Introduction

Async UI is a UI framework implemented for the web platform.
Write your UI in Rust, compile to WebAssembly, and run in web browsers.

Async UI has a new and unique design, leveraging the async features of Rust
to build UI (more on this in [the design chapter](./design/)).
We are still exploring the countless patterns possible under this design.
No idioms or opinionated conventions have been established yet.
Keep this in mind when working with Async UI ðŸ˜„.
