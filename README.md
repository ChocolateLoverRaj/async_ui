# Async UI

Async UI is a proof-of-concept Rust UI library with backend for the web (HTML/JS), and GTK 4. It is not ready for production use yet.

There's no documentation yet :( but you can read [my intro blog post](https://wishawa.github.io/posts/async-ui-intro/) for a rough idea of what this library does.
